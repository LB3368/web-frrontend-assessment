            <p class="about-info">I am a self-motivated person who is willing to go above and beyond on any project, and to learn valuable skills on my own time. For example, I taught myself several computer programming languages over the past few months, simply out of a passion to learn how to code. I believe that my experience being a skilled problem solver as well as a self-motivated person willing to go above and beyond on any project, specifically learning valuable skills on my own time, make me the best match for any developer position. </p>
